        <h4 id="ab" class="header">About the Race</h4>
        <p>
        Beginning in 1897, the Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. The race, held on the third Monday of April each year, attracts 500,000 spectators along the route. This makes it New England's most viewed sporting events. The famous 26.2 mile route spans through several cities and towns in greater Boston and eastern Massachusetts.
        </p>
        <h4 id="qu" class="header">Qualifying</h4>
        <p>
        The Boston Marathon is open to runners 18 or older from any nation, but they must meet certain qualifying standards. To qualify, a runner must first complete a standard marathon course certified by a national governing body affiliated with the World Athletics within a certain period of time before the date of the desired Boston Marathon (usually within approximately 18 months prior). Participants must complete the certified marathon course in their prospective qualifying times. These times are listed below.

        <p>
        Hundreds of thousands of runners try to qualify for Boston every year, and it is very competitive. If you are a man between the age of 18-34 you have to keep a 6:52 second pace for 26.2 miles to make the cut on the number. There is a small percentage of people who can do this. Another way to run the Boston Marathon is for runners who receive entries from partners. About one-fifth of the marathon's spots are reserved each year for charities, sponsors, vendors, licensees, consultants, municipal officials, local running clubs, and marketers.

        The first thing to consider is the four building blocks of marathon training. These are the basic fundamentals that form a runner's training regimen. <br>
        The primary elements of marathon training are:
        </p>
            <ol>
            <li class="bold">
                Base Mileage
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim to build your weekly mileage up to 50 miles over the four months leading up to the race.</li>
                    <li>Four to six runs per week is sufficient.</li>
                    <li>Never increase your weekly mileage by more than 10 percent from week to week. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="bold">
                The Long Run
                <ul>
                    <li>Build up to a weekly long run (typically done on Saturdays)</li>
                    <li>Extend the long run by a consistent mileage. One or two mile increment is good.</li>
                    <li>Most training plans peak at 20 miles. On race day adrenaline and crowd support will do the rest.</li>
                    <li>This helps increase your stamina over time to prepare you for the 26.2!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="bold">
                Speed Work
                <ul>
                    <li>Intervals -  set of repetitions of a specific, short distance, run at a substantially faster pace than usual, with recovery jogs in between.</li>
                    <li>Tempo runs - generally in the range of 4–10 miles, depending on where you are in your training—run at a challenging, but sustainable, pace.</li>
                    <li>The goal is a 6:52 mile on repeat, so remember to track your pace.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="bold">
                Rest and Recovery
                <ul>
                    <li>No running on rest days!</li>
                    <li>Cross-training is acceptable and can include walking, hiking, cycling, swimming, yoga, lifting weights, or any other active pursuit that isn't as high-impact as running.</li>
                    <li>Tapering - two or three weeks leading up to your marathon, scale back significantly on overall mileage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
